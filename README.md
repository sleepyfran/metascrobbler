## ðŸ›  Building

The project is built in TypeScript and is separated in a bunch of packages, each
of them with a different concern. The most useful package to run the project
locally is the `local` package which you can run with:

```bash
npm run build
npm run local
```

This will automatically install all the dependencies and link all the necessary
packages and finally run the local package.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Similarly for testing just run:

```bash
npm run build
lerna run test
```
